# Portfolio Website - Frontend

This is the frontend of my personal portfolio website. It includes a modern, responsive design to showcase my profile, skills, projects, and blog posts. It also integrates with a backend system to display and manage blog and other content.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The portfolio includes the following pages and features:

- **Home** – A welcoming landing page with a short introduction.

- **Skills** – Technologies and tools I work with.
- **Projects** – A collection of my personal projects.

This frontend is connected to a Node.js backend that handles blog, project and other data through APIs.
